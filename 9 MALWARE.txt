MALWARE

is malicious software that has been designed to cause damage by enabling unauthorized  access to systems or networks. Purpose of theft, espoinage or sabotage

USES:

1)DATA EXFILTRATION- data is raw, once converted to an actionable knowledge it becomes information
		-unauthorize transfer of data to an external entity

2)SPYING- RAT's (backdoors), keyloggers , spyware (tracks website visited)

3)RANSOMWARE - encrypt files then ask for a ransom in exchange for a decryption key

4)ATTACK CHANNEL - become part of botnet to be part of a DDoS attacks



MALWARE:INFILTRATION

1)SOFTWARE VULNERABILITIES- weakness in OS or apps

2)HUMAN WEAKNESS- clicking on malicious links from emails or websites. Installing untrusted softwares


MALWARE:DELIVERY

DROPPERS- small malware with small footprint
	-done by phishing email
	-helps establishing backdoors and keyloggers

MALAWRE:SAFETY TIPS
1)patching from trsuted sources
2)employee awareness

MALWRE TYPES:
1)Viruses - infects apps & files that insert themselves in their code (self-replicate)
	-can't run on it's own
	-fx: replication- reproduces itself. Destruction- corrupts data,files & apps
	-used to: steal data, launch ransomware or DoS, or just to annoy
	-types:
	1)boot sector - infects the boot loader (MBR) that loads the virus evrytime
			-easy to detect
			-loads itself first before MBR

	2)macro -infect microsft office documents that uses script functions
		
	3)stealth - hides from anti-virus
		-continually rename itself, move around the disk, or cahnge OS process
		-send the clean files when AV is scanning for evasion
		- AV scans  > request from OS > reqeust to file manager ; AV > request from OS > virus >sends clean files
	4)polymorphic - changes code to evade detection of anti-malware
	5)encrypted - encrypts itself to evade anti-malware

2)WORMS - similar to virus but don't attach to specific apps, it is auto-triggered ( no need for a user to execute)
	-attack vectors: network propagation to bring down a network
	-self propagate
	-my doom (2004) worm attaches itself to the email contacts and sends itself

3)TROJANS - tricks user to install what they think is legit through phishing email
	- RAT - isntalls backdoors
	-can perform: 1)keyloggin, screenshots, screen record,
			2)copy, modify or deltet data
			3)disrupts performance
			4)use infected systems to launch a DDoS
			5)advanced type can avaoid or disable anti-malware
	-DARKCOMET TRAP - plugs in the OS as a service that orovdies complete administrative control
	-Protection: never isntall untrusted software, avoid opening suspicious attachments, keep antivirus updated

4)SPYWARE ,ADWARE, RANSOMWARE
	1)spyware- collects info from PC's without consent
		-collects : internet vbrowsing habits, credentials, screenshots
		-used by attackers to sell to marketing companies
		-types:
		1)brwoser sesion hijacking- modifies user browser settings and re-directs ADS
		2)cookies & web bugs - used to store auth/preferrences to track users
		3)banking spyware - tragets banking apps. steals bank info
		4)keyloggers

	2)adware - malware that bombards user with unwanted ads
			-sometimes bundled with legit software
			-indicators: homepage changed, re-directed to different websites, and exploits add-on plugins
			-purpose: revenue generation when clicked
			-protection: don't isntall untrusted software, disable browser extensions & reset browser, and softwares like malwarebytes

	3)ransomware - finacially motivated malware
			-encrpyts data and ask money for decryption key
			-prevention: be vigilant, add IoC's to security tools

5)LOGIC BOMBS & ROOTKIT

LOGIC BOMBS- bits of malicious code that is triggered by specific event (date, time, events like sales or user registration)
		-usually launched by disgruntled employees taht have inside knowledge (knows the network, security weakness etc)
		-difficult to detect with small foot print
		
ROOT KITS - hidden software taht allows priv access access to system
	-allows remopte control in clandestine mode
	-conceals other malware (keyloggers, trojans,  viruses etc)
	-dificult to detect process to detect : behavioral patterns and memory dump analysis
	-removal often requires a complete rebuild of the system (they hide deep in the system)
	-best defense is patching
	-ring 0 = most priv while ring 3= least priv
	-1)kernel rootkit- runs in ring 0 that has full security access
	 2)user moder rootkit- runs in ring 3 that has damage limitation
	 3) hardware/firmware rootkit - hidden in device firmware (network cards, hard drives etc). Repalcement is the only option
	 4)bootkits- infects MBR. Often advance other malware

ANTIMALWARE- detects, protect and remove malware
	-types of scan
	1)on-demand - user defined
	2)real-time - loaded in the  background. Antimalware intecepts request as you make them
	-tyoes of detection:
	1)signature based - based on malware patterns from virus definitions
	
				-can't detect polymorphic or different strain ( signature must be known)
	2)anomaly-based - creates a baseline of normal usage. Detects deviation from what was set.
	**good solution to combine both
			
	-anti virus vs anti malware
	1)AV address old or established threats
	2)antimalware address emerging threats

	-malware: remediation
	CYCLE of remidiation:
	1)isolate infected systems
	2)treat the infected file/s
	3)determine the root cause (how we got infected?)
	4)recovery patch, restore/recover from last known good back up
	5)follow up by re-scanning the infected system

	-use backups, firewalls as defender and logs, and deploy anti virus anti malware solution.
