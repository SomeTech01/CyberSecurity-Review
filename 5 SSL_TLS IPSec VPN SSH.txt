HTTP vs HTTPS

1)HTTP - transmits data in palin text (port 80)
	-susceptible to eavesdropping
	-HTTPS preferred 

2)HTTPS- transmits encrypted data
	-lock icon means HHTPS


SSL vs TLS

1)ssl- secure socket layer
	-HTTPS = HTTP= SSL/TLS
	-depracated
2)tls- uses 443
	-client connects to 443 > sever responds with digital certificate
	-client and server agrees on the encryptiopn scheme

IPSEC VS HTTPS
1)HHTPS- works in the transport layer

	initially pubclic keys are used to create a session

	private keys are shared within that secure session since symmetric encryption is much faster


2)IPSEC -works on the network layer
	-encrypts the network layer regardless of the upper layer (encrypts again!)
	-can alsi use public and private key
	-used in VPN
	-provides CIA

	VPN - extend private network over a public network
	
	2 modes of IPSEC operation
		transport mode- encapsulate only the data (payload)
				-used for device to device secure connection
				-not encryptin IP header allows end-to0end routing 
				-EAVESDROPPER CAN SEE THE DESTINATION
		NEWDATA3 + AH/ESP + IP HEADER ( ONLY NEWDATA 3 IS ENCRYPTED)


		tunnel mode- encpsulates entire IP packet (including the header)
				-used for gateway to gateway secure tunnel
				-routers on the internet cant route your packet cause IP is also encrypted
				-to solve add a new header unencrypted IP header
				-once the unecrypted header is recieved the router extracts the encrypted content and sends it to the intent
				-EAVESDROPPER DOESNT KNOW THE DESTINATION
		NEWDATA3 + AH/ESP + NEW UNENCRYPTED HEADER ( NEWDATA3 AND PROTOCOL ARE BOTH ENCYPTED)




	2 protocols

		Authn header (AH)- focused on authn
		Encapsualting Security Payload (ESP) - authn + confidentiality


ssh- remote command excution
	-application layer
	-port 22 and use encryption to create a secure tunnel
