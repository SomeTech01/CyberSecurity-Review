NAT-network address translation
	-allows a single public ip address to handle thousands of system
	-hides the internal IP address
	-prevent connection initiation from outside
	-it modifies IP and port

192.168.1.2 (source)> NAT router 96.9.9.3 > router replaces the private ip to a public ip according to the table > 202.12.13.14 (destination) receives the packet 

sends back a reply> goes to the NAT router > router loks atthe table how he translated the first message > sends to the intent

**src and dst are not aware about the NAT router 

PAT- port addres translation
	-NAT requires one-to-one mapping of priv and pub ip. PAT differentiate multiple connection using the port 
	


FIREWALLS- first line of attacks
	-can be hardware,software or both
	-use rules: allow or block
	-types host-based (end systems), network-based (genral, whole network)
	-popular: palo alto, juniper, cisco
	
	ACCESS CONTROL LIST	
		-rules can allow/block bsed on:
			-source ip ( block known malicious IP address)
			-destination IP (block access to DB)
			-source port
			-destiantion port (block vulnerable ports (80,21)
			-protocol ( block vulnerable protocols icmp)

	CATEGORY

		stateless- configure both inbound and outbound rule
				-use destination/source of packet and other parameter 
		

		stateful- sets both rules automatically
			-inspect everythng insidethe packet. It can learn how data behaves

	NEXT GEN FIREWALL- application layer
			-deep packet inspection firewalls
			-application-level gateway firewall ( inspect also applications not just the network)
			-when app is known, it uses attack signature to ehnace it's capability
			-can detect patterns/payloads and block


************
WLANS- extends LAN to remote users
	-wireless access point bridges the lan and wireless network

	
	SSID- name of the network
		-all devices will broadcast the same name

	BSS- basic service set
		-group of stations to a WAP
		

	WIRELESS UNAUTHORIZE ACCESS
		ROUGE AP- malicious user introduces a rouge AP
			-tricks users to connect to them to steal data
			

		MAC SPOOFING - attacker masquerade as the legit user by re-using his MAC
				-

		MiTM- attacker in the middle and make to two parties think he is legit

	
	WIRELESS BASIC SECURITY

		SSID HIDING- wireless AP broadcast beacon fram every 30 secs (SSID, WAP's MAC, IP address)
				-hiding the SSID means disabling the beacon frame

		MAC FILTERING -MAC's are burnt into the device	
				-whitelist known MAC
				-MAC spoofing is an issue

	WIFI SECURITY

		WEP- wired equivalent privacy
			-weak security, first encryption
			-easily broken
			-short keys (40-140 bits)
			-RC4 encryption

		WPA-TKIP- WIFI protected access
			-address the weaknessof WEP
			-increases key length
			-TKIP temporal key integrity protocol
				TKIP genrates a dynamic 128-bit key for every packet
			-based on wep so some flaws are inheritted
			-RC4 encryption

		WPA2- version 2
			-uses AES (idustry-standard)
			-longer keys
			-strong security
			-dynamic session key
